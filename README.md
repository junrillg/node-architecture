## Getting Setup
#### Download [Node v8+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or install by [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)

Check if Node is succesfully installed:
```sh
$ node -v
```

#### Install Dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```
#### Starting the app

run client:
```sh
$ npm run webpack-dev
```

run server:
```sh
$ npm run start
```

On development, run client & server at one go
```sh
$ npm run dev
```

#### Running tests

```sh
$ npm test
```
#### Local development:
http://localhost:3000/#/ 

For server side, this repo uses 3001 as the default port number, if you want to change to a port number you prefered, add it to your own .env file and change your axios baseUrl (do not commit this)

#### Dev Tools

There are a few chrome extensions that make development a breeze.

- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- [Redux DevTools extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)

## Some more explanations
#### .env
local development env variables. For an existing copy click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eBrScTPJYRMmVXSi4IBaaXugL3lj-Xso9IDf0LL_bDw/edit?usp=sharing)
#### test
This repo uses jest as the main test framework. For component tests, you can either choose jest + enzyme or jest snapshots. There are two examples set for Place.js.
For debugging purpose, tests can be ran under auto reload mode
```sh
$ npm run test-tdd
```

To update the snapshots after logic changes:
```sh
$ npm run jest-update
```
Note that it's your responsibility to make sure the updated snapshots are the correct ones

Api tests, server side, saga are still pending for tests to be implemented.

**For any new logics, please add tests in.**

#### node
Server side uses await, if you prefer to use Promise, please go ahead

#### Eslint
Please make sure there are no eslint errors, for your convenience, it is recommended to install eslint on your local editor.

#### ES6
This repo uses es6 syntax. Please stick with it.

#### CSS
This repos uses CSS module and with PostCSS plugins. In general, you can define your style as global styles or component styles which stays within each component directory

#### Trouble shooting
Windows native cmd users, you may experience erros saying env is not recognised as internal command, in this case you may want to switch to a more advanced terminal
